In her first term at the Corporation Commission, she was able to work with the Republican majority led by Kris Mayes on the Commission to advance solar energy and energy efficiency. She is the first and only African American in Arizona to hold statewide office. \n\nSandra Kennedy was re-elected to the Corporation Commission in 2018 on a platform of restoring integrity to the Commission, lowering unjustified utility rate increases, and \ncreating more solar and renewable energy in Arizona, especially roof top solar. \n\nTo stop Sandra Kennedy’s re-election to the Corporation Commission in 2014, opponents mounted an infamous, multi-million dollar dark money campaign to defame her. Her re-election in 2018 was a repudiation of the dark money interests and efforts. After winning in 2018, Sandra forced Pinnacle West through a subpoena to disclose all its Dark Money spending, and also promoted solar and renewables, energy efficiency, and lower utility rates.\n\nSandra started her public service when she was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in November 1986, where she served for six years before successfully becoming a state senator in 1992. She served three terms as state senator. She co-authored and introduced the first Domestic Violence Bill in Arizona during her tenure in the legislature. Concurrent with her stint in the legislature, Sandra was elected to serve on the Phoenix Union High School Governing Board for a four year term in 1990. Governor Mofford appointed her to the Arizona Employment and Training Council. \n\nHer other many past and present community and civic projects include the following: Tutor for Valley Christian Center and Valle Del Sol (grades 5-8); Board member of the Arizona Cactus Pine Girl Scout Council; ex-Officio Member of Phoenix Community Alliance; and a former Board member of the Community Excellence Project. \n\nMs. Kennedy was voted Outstanding Young Woman of America for 1984. She is a member of the National Association of Female Executives, was a delegate to the Foreign Relations Conference in June of 1988 from the American Council of Young Political Leaders in Washington, D.C., and also a member of the National Conference of State Legislators. She also attended the 2007 DNC Diversity Conference.\n\nSandra is a mother, a wife, and a grandmother.\n\n" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -112.066076011703998, 33.599682276202699 ] } },

As a result of her work with community members, Tempe leads the state in climate action-planning and bold, empathetic justice for families and people of all genders. \n\nA fighter for what she believes in, Lauren is known for her bold, practical climate activism and determination in the face of powerful special interests. In 2015, Lauren labored to pass an ordinance banning single-use plastic bags in Tempe. When special interests retaliated by passing a law that banned banning plastic bags, Lauren joined with Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest to sue the state.

They were well known in Mesa for serving on community boards that advocated for equity and inclusion. Her father went on to become a small business owner and civil rights attorney, known for building relationships and creating community organizations. Lorena currently works alongside her father in hopes of continuing the advancement of communities in Mesa. \n\nWhile Austin’s father’s family has deep roots within Mesa, Lorena spent part of her childhood living with her mother in central California. While growing up, Austin’s family spent periods of time in section 8 housing and homeless shelters due to economic hardship and financial instability.

This desire to work comes from both sides of her family as both her father’s and mother’s family include farm workers. It is this strong work ethic to get things done for her community that drives Lorena today. \n\nAustin proudly graduated from Mesa Community College (\"MCC\")  as an honor student and student body president. She went on to graduate from the School of Transborder Studies at Arizona State University with a degree in Chicano/a Latino/a Studies, where she focused on U.S. & Mexican Regional Immigration Policy and Economy and obtained a certificate in Cross-Sector Leadership.  Austin graduated Summa Cum Laude and was awarded the prestigious Dean's Medal for her academic and co-curricular achievements at Arizona State University (\"ASU\").

She has worked as a military forecaster in Europe in support of military operations in both Kosovo and Bosnia, and even worked in Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\nIn 2003, Nicole transferred from the National Guard into the Air Force Reserves, where she worked as a Weather Officer for the Hurricane Hunters, a unit which performs reconnaissance missions into tropical weather to gather data which aids in the forecasting of tropical storms and hurricanes, until 2019. Storms she has flown into include hurricanes Charley, Katrina, Wilma, and Harvey.
